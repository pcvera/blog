Hello! Basically the information architecture on this site doesn't make much sense if there's only one blog post, so I'm adding this one as a way to make it make more sense.

I've been a software engineer in the Silicon Valley, coming up on 16 years now. The main problems I find interesting are systems that help other engineers deliver their stuff, and complex user interactions. 

Most of my recreational coding comes from working on puzzlehunts, which I do with the team Cardinality. The main type of puzzle that I like to write is one that makes you engage with some new, slightly cursed knowledge about the world.

See my past puzzlehunt work:
